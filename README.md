# Choosing the Right Tool for your Modern ETL Workloads

## What is ETL?
ETL stands for **Extract, Transform, Load**. It's a process used to:
1. **Extract** data from various sources.
2. **Transform** it into a usable format.
3. **Load** it into a destination system like a data warehouse for analysis.

### Why Modern ETL Tools?
Traditional ETL tools are slow and hard to scale. Modern tools are:
- **Faster**: Built for large data volumes.
- **Flexible**: Work well with cloud platforms.
- **Scalable**: Handle growing workloads efficiently.
